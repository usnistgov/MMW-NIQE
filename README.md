# MMW-NIQE
Python code for calculating the MMW-NIQE score for millimeter wave images.
Details of the MMW-NIQE image quality score will be given in an updated paper by Gupta et al.
The model in this code was trained to score the images produced by the 10-40 GHz PNNL systems sometimes referred to as HD-AIT or the laboratory prototype.
This is the millimeter system used in the "Passenger Screening Algorithm Challenge" Kaggle competition.
